## Face Detection & Blurring API

It’s a fact: people have a right of getting  digital privacy. Here’s one more: online publishers and businesses worldwide must respect those rights and provide visual anonymity when it’s needed. That’s why we decided to give you the fastest and easiest way to keep people’s privacy in photos. Meet Face Detection & Blurring  by MapmyIndia.

<img src="./docs/images/FaceDetectionAndBlurring.gif?raw=true" width="1000px" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>

<br>

This tool completely automates Face Detection, Face Blurring in photos and helps you get the job done in just a few clicks without graphic editors and manual work. Keep reading to find out how it works, when it comes in handy, and how you can actually use it in MapmyIndia.

<br>

You can detect faces in an image, identify key facial features, and get the contours of detected faces. Note that the API detects faces, it does not recognize people .

Also, if you have any difficulties using this feature or suggestions on how we can improve the existing functionality, feel free to create a post in our Community Area.

### How Algorithm Works
<br>

First, the API takes input as an image. If the end user wants face/license plate detection then an image with bounding box on the faces/license plates would be displayed. However, if the end user wants face/license plate blurring then blurred image would be displayed in the API as an output. the algorithm adds a layer that blurs them out with Gaussian Blurring (also known as smoothing), which reduces image details so that facial/license plate features can no longer be seen by the human eye.
<br>

To test the application, upload a JPG, PNG file containing at least one face/license plate into the API. After a few seconds, the destination bucket contains the output file, with the same name. The output file shows blur content when the objects are detected:
All operations are done with MapmyIndia Face Detection & Blurring API and take just a few minutes to set up.
<br>
<br>


<br>





## Brand Detection API

Using these APIs Data Team can fully leverage and embed the power of AI Based Brand Detection from seen imagery data and Finding ROI( Region of Interest) of Detected brand detection as per the their own requirement.These ROI could be downloaded as a CSV file and used for data extraction.

This model has been implemented on YOLOv5 model that effectively detect Brand Detection. High robustness in real complex scenarios such as in cloudy, sunny, rainy and at night is achieved. Real-time detection upto 33 frames per second.

# New Object blurring API.


## Object Detection


## Introduction
<br>
Sending visuals that include customers’ personal information, employee data, or company secrets can lead to a multitude of issues. In fact, many countries (and even individual states) have laws that govern how personally identifiable information can be shared both inside and outside your organization.

Trust us, you never want to go through all the difficulties that improperly sharing private information can lead to.

What happens when you need or want to share an image, but there are elements of it that you’d rather not (or can’t let) people see?

You could remove info within your original document by restricting permissions or versions, but beware! There are ways to get around this type of security.

Thankfully, there’s a better (and easier!) way.

Blur it out!

An API to blur any kind of object on the image. User would give bounding box of the region he/she wants to blur and with it the image he wants the operation to be performed and our latest blurring  API would blur the specified region. 
<br>
<br>

This API has more advance features  in compare with the face blurring API
